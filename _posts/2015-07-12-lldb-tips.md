Three tips that make debugging easier.

# Step faster
Stepping over/into in the debugger can be really slow. Turns out that Debug navigator is the main culprit here. If it gets slow just hide navigator pane (⌘+0) or change to different navigator and enjoy full speed <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.

# Print bounds/frame like a normal person
Checking view's bounds in LLDB by default produces this error:

```
(lldb) po self.view.bounds
error: property 'bounds' not found on object of type 'UIView *'
error: 1 errors parsing expression
```

There's a bunch of workarounds for this. Most sane one was added in Xcode 6.3 with LLDB enchancements: expression parser can now import modules.

```
(lldb) e @import UIKit
(lldb) po self.view.bounds
(origin = (x = 0, y = 0), size = (width = 320, height = 548))
 (origin = (x = 0, y = 0), size = (width = 320, height = 548))
 ```

Entering import at the start of each debugging session gets tedious very quickly. To streamline this use Symbolic Breakpoint in a fashion similar to [this Reveal tutorial](http://support.revealapp.com/kb/getting-started/integrating-reveal-load-reveal-without-changing-your-xcode-project). Go to Debuger pane and add Symbolic Breakpoint pointing to `UIApplicationMain` (it's guaranteed to run only once), add `e @import UIKit` action and set it to automatically continue after evaluating. Using breakpoint's context menu: `Move Breakpoint To -> User`, make it an user breakpoint and enjoy it in every project from now on <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. 

# Breakpoint by regular expression on function name
Use case for this can be for example setting a breakpoint on all `isEqual:` implementations:

```
(lldb) breakpoint set --func-regex isEqual:
```

Shorthand:

```
(lldb) br s -r isEqual:
```

To view all added locations:

```
(lldb) br list
...
6: regex = 'isEqual:', locations = 330, resolved = 330, hit count = 0
  6.1: where = UIKit`-[UIBezierPath isEqual:], address = 0x0000000103dccdc5, resolved, hit count = 0 
  6.2: where = UIKit`-[_UIGraphicsLetterpressStyle isEqual:], address = 0x0000000103dd84b4, resolved, hit count = 0 
  6.3: where = UIKit`-[_UIResizableImage isEqual:], address = 0x0000000103dd9f8d, resolved, hit count = 0 
  6.4: where = UIKit`-[_UIAnimatedImage isEqual:], address = 0x0000000103ddb1b7, resolved, hit count = 0 
  6.5: where = UIKit`-[_UIMappedBitmapImage isEqual:], address = 0x0000000103ddb68f, resolved, hit count = 
```

Disabling and deleting all locations for such breakpoint:

```
(lldb) br disable 6
(lldb) br delete 6
```
