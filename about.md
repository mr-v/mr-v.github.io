My name is Witold Skibniewski. I'm an iOS developer from Wroc≈Çaw. In this blog I'll share what I learned about Swift, unit testing, and writing maintainable code. Occasionally there will be some productivity/utility tips.

You can send me an email at witold.skibniewski at gmail.com.

Thanks for reading!
